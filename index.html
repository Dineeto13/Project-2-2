<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Currently I’m a restaurant manager in El Segundo trying to climb the ladder. I’ve been on the 2-year transfer plan for 19 years at ElCo, but I think CIS is my way out. I thought of an app a couple of years ago that’s going to change the game! and I’ve been teaching myself how to code ever since. Meanwhile, I realized that I can get a certificate and an AS while I’m at it, so might as well right? I did fail this class once though… Fun for me is being on the guest side of the restaurant experience, exploring the latests and the greatest, as well as the classics.</p>

My favorite website is
<a href="https://www.myspace.com/">My Space</a>
because there is no school like the old school.
